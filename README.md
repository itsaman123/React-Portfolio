## How to Use

## Step 1: Clone the GitHub Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the GitHub repository containing the React application:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the GitHub repository you want to clone. For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/my-react-app.git
```

This command will clone the repository into a new directory named `my-react-app`.

## Step 2: Navigate to Your Application Directory

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the directory using the following command:

```bash
cd my-react-app
```

Replace `my-react-app` with the name of the directory where your repository was cloned.

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

Before running the React application, you need to install its dependencies. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will install all the necessary dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

## Step 4: Start the Development Server

To start the development server and run your React application locally, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will compile your React code and launch a development server. By default, your application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Step 5: View Your React Application

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view your React application. You should see the application running in the browser.
